Simple weather app Java. Uses OpenWeatherMap via the Spring / Spring Boot frameworks. 
Two service classes for learning purposes: one does the requests manually and one uses RestTemplate. 
Data then exposed using REST controller. 
Also has a unit and integration test for service class using Junit 5, Mockito and Spring Boot tests.
